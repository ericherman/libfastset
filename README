An implementation of "Using Uninitialized Memory for Fun and Profit"
http://research.swtch.com/sparse

This is a set implementation for which all operations are O(1) ...
 (except set iteration which is O(n), which is obviously the best case).

This performance boost comes by trading memory for speed. Specifically,
this is terribly inefficient in terms of space, because it allocates twice
the amount of memory as required to hold the maxinum number of elements.
